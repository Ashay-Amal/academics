Review of Literature
LongT5 1 a new texttotext transformer for long sequences LongT5 is
based on the T5 transformer architecture but it makes several modifications
to improve its performance on long sequences These modifications include
Using a new attention mechanism that is more efficient for long sequences
Pretraining LongT5 on a dataset of long sequences Scaling up the size of
LongT5 On the evaluation of LongT5 on several summarization and question
answering tasks They show that LongT5 outperforms the original T5 model on
these tasks and it achieves stateoftheart results on some of them However
LongT5 is not yet as widely used as other language models so there is less
research available on its strengths and weaknesses
PEGASUS 2 a new pretraining method for abstractive summarization
PEGASUS is based on the Transformer language model but it makes sev
eral modifications to improve its performance on abstractive summarization
These modifications include Using a new objective function that encourages
the model to generate summaries that are both informative and fluent Pre
training PEGASUS on a dataset of humanwritten summaries and their corre
sponding source documents On the evaluation of PEGASUS on several sum
marization tasks They show that PEGASUS outperforms the stateoftheart
on these tasks But the authors of the paper do not compare their model to other
models that have been pretrained on similar datasets

takeaways from an AIpowered model The system uses techniques such as
Data Preprocessing Webscraping and a transformer model to generate the
output
The activity diagram shows the following steps
1 The user inputs the topic they want to research
2 The system preprocesses the query and finds out relevant topics
3 The model performs webscraping for the given topic
4 The scraped data is further preprocessed and fed to the summarization and
sentence ranking model

The above diagrams show the data flow of the system in three levels which are
Level 0 Level 1 and Level 2
Level 0 shows the overall interaction between the user and the system The User
inputs the Query to the model and gets a Summary and Key Takeaways as the
output The model scraps the data from the academic websites for generating
the output
Level 1 is further divided into 2 sublevels focusing in more detail about the
individual actors separately giving more information about the data flow in the
system
Level 2 focuses on each module starting from the User input which is given to
the model for webscrapping This Scraped data is used to generate Summaries
and Key takeaways which are displayed to the user as the final output

Preprocessing the question
Tokenization Split the question into individual words or tokens This can be
done using libraries like NLTK
Stopword Removal Remove common stop words eg the is in from
the list of tokens These words often dont contribute significantly to the mean
ing and are unlikely to be keywords
512
Web scraping
The sample data was preprocessed by For web scraping the research papers
the requests html library is used in Python It has an HTMLSession object
that opens a browser window Chromium for scraping After creating a ses
sion a get request can be sent to the desired link using the get function in the
HTMLSession class It calls the request function to create a request for a given
URL which then returns a response The render function is used to load the
Javascript on the website before scraping After the page is loaded we use the
find function to extract the desired data
513
Preprocessing the web data
The data that we extracted from the web may not be in a format that is suitable
for further processes In this step we will need to clean the data by removing
any unwanted characters correcting any errors and converting the data into a
consistent formatEx UTF8
514
Abstractive Summarisation
A Transformer is used for abstractive summarisation specifically the LongT5
model The LongT5 model works by first encoding the input text into a se
quence of tokens These tokens are then passed through the Transformer en
coder which learns to identify the relationships between the tokens The en
coded tokens are then passed through the Transformer decoder which generates
the output summary

Sentence Ranking
Find out key takeaways from all the papers These key takeaways give us an
idea about the essential sentences from the papers TextRank turns out to be
well suited for this type of application since it allows for a ranking over text
units that is recursively computed based on information drawn from the entire
text

outputs It is calculated by comparing the machine translation output to a set of

sible for analyzing and representing the input sequence in a way the model can
understand The encoder processes the input sequence and produces a contin
uous representation or embedding of the input These embeddings are then
passed to the decoder to generate the output sequence Each layer of the en
coder contains a selfattention mechanism that allows the model to weigh the
importance of different input sequence parts by calculating the embeddings dot
product This mechanism is also known as multihead attention
The decoder also typically consists of multiple layers including a selfattention
mechanism and a feedforward network The decoder uses the embeddings pro
duced by the encoder and its internal states to generate the output sequence
Attention Mechanism of LongT5
Figure 62 Illustration of the two attention mechanisms experimented with in LongT51
For Local Attention the sparse slidingwindow local attention operation al
lows a given token to attend only r tokens to the left and right of it with r127
by default Local Attention does not introduce any new parameters to the
model The complexity of the mechanism is linear in input sequence length l
Ol r Transient Global Attention is an extension of Local Attention It fur
thermore allows each input token to interact with all other tokens in the layer
18
Chapter 6
Implementation
This is achieved via splitting an input sequence into blocks of a fixed length
k with a default k16 Then a global token for such a block is obtained via
summing and normalizing the embeddings of every token in the block Thanks
to this the attention allows each token to attend to both nearby tokens like in
Local attention and also every global token like in the case of standard global
attention transient represents the fact the global tokens are constructed dynam
ically within each attention operation As a consequence TGlobal attention
introduces a few new parameters  global relative position biases and a layer
normalization for global tokens embedding The complexity of this mechanism
is Olr lk
