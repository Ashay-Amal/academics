ABSTRACT
Zimmerman and Weissenburger’s ﬂutter margin method is widely used to estimate the aeroelastic
coalescence ﬂutter speed. In contrast to aeroelastic decay rates, the ﬂutter margin exhibits monotonic
decay with respect to airspeed redering it effective in extrapolating the ﬂutter speed using ﬂight
test data conducted at pre-ﬂutter airspeeds. This paper reports the generalization of the Bayesian
formulation of the ﬂutter margin method by Khalil et al. developed to tackle measurement and
modeling uncertainties. This paper improves the predictive performance of the previous algorithm
by incorporating the joint prior of aeroelastic modal frequencies and decay rates among airspeeds in
order to better estimate the joint posterior of modal parameters using observational data. The modal
parameter prior is constructed using the classical two-degree-of-freedom pitch-plunge aeroelastic
model whose system matrices (e.g. structural stiffness and damping matrices) vary randomly. Such
joint modal parameter prior enforces statistical dependence among posteriors of modal parameters
and the associated ﬂutter margins across airspeeds. Numerical studies demonstrate a considerable
reduction of uncertainties on the predicted ﬂutter speed obtained from the generalized Bayesian
ﬂutter margin method. This improved algorithm can cut cost by reducing the number of ﬂight tests
and better assess the uncertainty against aeroelastic ﬂutter.

Introduction
The aeroelastic ﬂutter instability can be predicted tracking damping against airspeed or dynamic pressure. At the
critical airspeed at which the ﬂutter instability occurs, the damping of the unstable aeroelastic mode becomes zero.
However, this prediction approach experiences difﬁculties as the damping may not exhibit monotonic decay against
airspeed. Furthermore, the damping estimates obtained using noisy and sparse observational data exhibit large scat-
ter or uncertainties, compared to the estimated aeroelastic frequencies. For the coalescence ﬂutter for which two
aeroelastic modes participate in the instability, Zimmerman and Weissenburger [1] deﬁnes the ﬂutter margin using the
aeroelastic modal frequencies (ω1, ω2) and decay rates (β1, β2) as:

The ﬂutter margin, a stability indicator, tends to zero when the system becomes unstable at the ﬂutter speed. In
contrast to the decay rate, the ﬂutter margin monotonically decays to zero at the critical (ﬂutter) airspeed. By nature,
the aeroelastic modal frequencies have more inﬂuence on coalescence ﬂutter that decay rates. They also generally
exhibit less scatter in their estimates than the decay rates. Note from Eq.(1), the expression of ﬂutter margin includes
the modal frequencies ω1 and ω2 which leads to its better performance (than just decay rates) in predicting ﬂutter
speed. Under certain practical assumptions (e.g. quasi-steady aerodynamics, negligible structural damping etc.), the
ﬂutter margin approximately becomes a function of airspeed U as (e.g. [2]):
F(U) = B1U 4 + B2U 2 + B3
(2)
2
Using the above equation, the ﬂutter speed can be estimated using the ﬂight test data obtained from subcritical (pre-
ﬂutter) airspeeds. This process involves the following steps. At a given airspeed U, the aeroelastic modal frequencies
(ω1, ω2) and decay rates (β1, β2) are estimated using noisy and sparse ﬂight test data in order to estimate the ﬂutter
margin in Eq.(1). Using the estimates of the ﬂutter margin at a number of subcritical airspeeds, the parameters B1,
B2 and B3 can be estimated using the method of least-squares. Finally, the ﬂutter speed Uf can be computed as the
positive real root of the equation:
B1U 4
f + B2U 2
f + B3 = 0
(3)
The ﬂutter margin method proposed by Zimmerman and Weissenburger [1] has had signiﬁcant impact on ﬂutter
ﬂight test. Earlier use of the ﬂutter margin method to wind tunnel data on aircraft wing is presented by Bennett [3].
Zimmerman and Weissenburger implemented Routh’s stability criteria to derive a ﬂutter margin equation for 2D
airfoil with quasi-steady aerodynamics [1, 2, 4]. The ﬂutter margin equation constitutes of frequencies (ω1, ω2), and
the decay rates (β1, β2) of the aeroelastic modes participating in the ﬂutter at a given airspeed U [1]. The positive
ﬂutter margin indicates a stable aeroelastic system. The ﬂutter margin’s dependence on airspeed is given by Eq.(2).
The airspeed at which F = 0 is the ﬂutter speed [1].
Various extension of the original ﬂutter margin method [1] have been proposed. Price and Lee [5] extended the ﬂutter
margin method to the cases where the ﬂutter mechanism involves three aeroelastic modes, leading to the so-called
trinary ﬂutter. Torii and Matsuzaki [6] extended the ﬂutter margin method to the discrete-time systems using Jury’s
stability analysis. Dimitriadis and Cooper [7] compared the predictive performance of the ﬂutter margin method
against several other methods, based on damping ﬁt, response envelope function, Nissim and Gilyard method and
autoregressive moving average method. The presence of considerable uncertainties in the modal parameter estimates
prompted Poirel et al. [8] to introduce probabilistic ﬂutter margin method. Due to the nonlinear relationships among
the modal parameters, ﬂutter margin and ﬂutter speed, the Gaussian approximation of modal parameters translates
to non-Gaussian pdfs of ﬂutter margins and ﬂutter speed as demostrated using F18 ﬂight data [8]. Heege [9] futher
examined this method to compute the ﬂutter speed within the framework of maximum likelihood estimation. Abbasi
and Cooper [10] concluded that the ﬂutter margin pdfs become non-Gaussian as the aeroelastic frequencies come
closer, being a typical feature of coalescence ﬂutter.
Khalil et al. [2, 4, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15] formulated the probabilistic ﬂutter margin method by Poirel et al. [8] within the
framework of Bayesian inference. Using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, the joint samples of the
modal parameters are generated ﬁrst from the noisy measurement data at pre-ﬂutter airspeeds which are ﬁnally used
to construct the pdf of ﬂutter speed. However, several simplifying assumptions are made in this approach: (a) the ﬂat
(uniform) priors with positive supports are assumed at each airspeed, (b) while modal damping and frequencies are
statistically correlated at each airspeed, they are statistically independent at different airspeed. Consequently, the ﬂutter
margin are also statistically independent at different airspeeds. The current investigation generalizes the Bayesian
ﬂutter margin method by Khalil at al. [2, 4, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15] by relaxing these simplifying assumptions. First, the
prior pdfs of modal parameters are constructed using the parametric uncertainty quantiﬁcation method for a classical
pitch-plunge airfoil whose system properties (e.g. structural stiffness and damping) exhibit random variabilities. Note
that no (aeroelastic) model was used in the previous investigation. This joint modal prior (i.e. joint prior pdf of modal
frequencies and decay rates for airspeeds) considers statistical dependence among modal parameters within and across
airspeeds. The posterior MCMC samples of the modal parameters are generated using this joint modal parameter prior
and the likelihood function obtained from measurement data at various airspeeds. Consequently, the pdf of ﬂutter
speed is estimated using the joint statistics of ﬂutter margins for all airspeeds at which tests are conducted. In this
case, the uncertainty is signiﬁcantly reduced in the ﬂutter speed prediction compared to the case of non-informative
modal parameter prior and the statistical independence of margins across airspeeds.

Dynamics of a two-dimensional airfoil with quasi-steady aerodynamics
In this section, the dynamics of a simple two-dimensional (2D) pitch-plunge airfoil is described as shown in Fig.(1).
The formulation of the quasi-steady aerodynamics is adapted from [16, 17, 18]. The parametric uncertainty analysis
will be conducted on this system in order to construct the prior of modal frequencies and decay rates.
An extensive body of literature exists on the parametric uncertainty quantiﬁcation in aeroelastic systems. Pettit [19, 20]
reported the effect of parametric uncertainty on the aeroelastic behavior of an airfoil undergoing limit cycle oscilla-
tions. Kurdi [21] studied Goland wing to estimate ﬂutter boundaries using Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) due to
random variabilities in structural parameters. Castravete [22] used a cantilever airfoil to highlight the inﬂuence of
uncertain stiffness on aeroelastic ﬂutter analysis. Ueda [23] studied the effect of uncertainty in the location of the
center of gravity and elastic axis of an aeroelastic system. Borello [24] investigated the inﬂuence of random Young’s
modulus, shear modulus and mass on ﬂutter speed prediction. Khodaparasi [25] used probabilistic and fuzzy logic
3
methods to quantify uncertainty in ﬂutter boundaries in the presence of uncertain structural parameters. Poirel and
Price [26] conducted a probabilistic analysis to study the effect of random airspeed on the ﬂutter analysis of a typical
section.

The proportional Rayleigh damping is set with respect to the structural mass and stiffness matrices given by the
following equation (e.g. [29]):
[Bstr] = α0[Mstr] + α1[Kstr]

Solving the eigenvalue problem, two pairs of complex conjugate roots are obtained as [30]
si = βi ± iωi
(14)
where βi and ωi are the negative decay rate and the frequency respectively.

Application of Bayesian Inference in ﬂutter speed estimation
The free decay response (heave or pitch) of the aeroelastic system described in Eq.(6) can be expressed as [4, 30]:
uk = ˆuk + ηk,
k = 1, ..., N
(15)
and
ˆuk = a1e−β1tk cos(ω1tk + b1) + a2e−β2tk cos(ω2tk + b2)
(16)
where ηk is the Gaussian noise with zero mean and variance γ; and it can account for both measurement and model
errors (e.g. due to the effects of higher aeroelastic modes neglected in the 2-dof pitch-plunge model and the inﬂuence
of unsteady aerodynamics [2]). While we have considered a white noise process to model the measurement noise
(leading to statistically independent {ηk}s, i.e. E(ηiηj) = 0, i ̸= j where E denotes the expectation operator) as the
initial step, further studies are needed to investigate the beneﬁts of colored, non-stationary and non-Gaussian noise
models (e.g. [31]).
The likelihood function of these unknown parameters
αp = {a1, a2, b1, b2, β1, β2, ω1, ω2, γ} is [2]:
p(uk=1:N|αp) =
1
(2πγ)N/2 exp
N
�
k=1
− 1
2γ (uk − ˆuk(αp))2
(17)
Using Bayesian formulation, the posterior pdf of the parameter is given by:
p(αnu
p |unu
k=1:N) ∝ p(unu
k=1:N|αnu
p )p(αnu
p )
(18)
5
where nu is the index of airspeed at which experiments are conducted, and the prior pdf p(αnu
p ) is estimated us-
ing the parametric uncertainty quantiﬁcation method through MCS [28].
Samples of modal parameters ˆαq =
(βnu
1 , βnu
2 , ωnu
1 , ωnu
2 ) in Eq.(14) are generated using Monte Carlo simulation by solving the eigenvalue problem. In
Khalil et al. [2], the noise variance γ was estimated to account for both model and measurement errors as the unsteady
aerodynamic model was used to generate the synthetic data (corrupted by a Gaussian measurement noise) while the
quasi-steady aerodynamic model was used for the inference. In the current case, the quasi-steady aerodynamic model
is used for both generating synthetic data and inference. In this case, γ denotes only measurement noise which is
assumed to be known (hence γ is not estimated). The ﬂat (non-informative) priors are used for a1, a2, b1 and b2.
The prior pdf p(ˆαq) of the modal parameters is approximated to be Gaussian as given by [4, 32]:
p(ˆαi
q) =
1
�
(2π)q| �
i | exp
�
−1
2(ˆαi
q − µi)T �−1
i (ˆαi
q − µi)
�
, i = 1, ..., nu
(19)
where µi and �
i are the mean vector and covariance matrix of ˆαi
q respectively (where q = 4, being the dimension of
the modal parameter vector). Although the Gaussian approximation of the modal prior is adequate (as explained later)
for this investigation, the proposed method is general and can handle any non-Gaussian prior.
For the independent Gaussian measurement noise, the joint parameter posterior for airspeeds at the nu points is given
by:
p(α1
p, . . . , αnu
p |u1
k=1:N, . . . , unu
k=1:N) ∝ p(α1
p, . . . , αnu
p )
nu
�
i=1
p(ui
k=1:N|αi
p).
(20)
where the prior p(α1
p, · · · , αnu
p ) is estimated using parametric uncertainty quantiﬁcation [28]. Using Eq.(20), the
posterior samples of (α1
p, · · · , αnu
p ) are generated using the AMMCMC (e.g. [33]) sampling technique. The imple-
mentational details of the AMMCMC are available [34]. Using these samples, the corresponding samples of ﬂutter
margin are obtain using Eq.(1) and subsequently the joint pdf of ﬂutter margin p(F|B) is generated. The joint pdf of
ﬂutter margin p(F|B) is used to estimate unknown coefﬁcients B = {B1, B2, B3} from Eq.(2) using the Bayesian
formulation as [2, 15]:
p(B|F) ∝ p(F|B)p(B)
(21)
where
p(F|B) = p(F 1, . . . , F nu|α1
p, . . . , αnu
p ).
(22)
In Eq.(2), the ﬂutter margin is very sensitive to the accuracy of B1 term [1, 2, 3]. To tackle the issue, it is preferred to
use the following second order polynomial as suggested by Zimmerman and Weissenburger [1] as well as Bennett [3]:
F = B2U 2 + B3
(23)
where its positive real root provides the ﬂutter speed. Moreover, the prior of p(B) is given by [2, 15]
p(B) ∝
�1,
if B2, B3 satisfy conditions(1) and (2).
0,
otherwise.
(24)
where
condition(1): B2 < 0
condition(2): B3 > 0
Condition 1 reﬂects that the ﬂutter speed has real roots and condition 2 ensures the ﬂutter margin is positive at zero
airspeed [2, 15].
In order to highlight the beneﬁt of the current formulation compared to previous investigations [4, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15],
the following cases are considered:
1. Flat prior: At each airspeed, the prior of model parameter vector is considered to be uniformly distributed
with a large support (also positivity enforced for modal parameters) as in Khalil et al. [4, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]:
p(αi
p) ∝ 1, i = 1, ..., nu.
(25)
The model parameter vectors and ﬂutter margins are statistically independent at different airspeeds, leading
to:
p(α1
p, . . . , αnu
p ) =
nu
�
i=1
p(αi
p)
(26)
6
and
p(F 1, . . . , F nu) =
nu
�
i=1
p(F i)
(27)
This case relates to the previous work by Khalil et al. [4, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]
2. Independent prior: While the statistical dependence among the model parameters are now considered at a
given airspeed, the model parameter priors and ﬂutter margins are still assumed to be independent from one
airspeed to another as described in Eq.(26) and Eq.(27). The results of this case are new contributions of
this paper.
3. Joint prior: The statistical dependence is now consider among modal parameter vectors and ﬂutter margins
at all airspeeds. The results of this general case are new contributions.
4
Deterministic baseline
The nominal values of the system parameters in Table 1 (values in the middle column) are used for deterministic
simulation. The results in this section provide true estimate of ﬂutter speed which is used to compare the results
obtained from the Bayesian method. The calculated ﬂutter speed (FS) is 54.01 m/s as shown in Figure (2). The ﬂutter
margin calculated using Eq.(1) is plotted using the blue line solid line (FM: method1). Five ﬂutter margin values
are plotted in red dots at airspeeds ranging from 50% to 70% of the ﬂutter speed. Using these ﬁve data points, the
ﬂutter margin is estimated by the least square ﬁt (dashed line, FM: method2) using Eq.(23). The inaccuracy in the
least square estimate of ﬂutter speed using Eq.(23) is evident in Figure (2). The aeroelastic (modal) frequencies and
decay rates versus airspeed are plotted in Figure (3) and Figure (4) respectively. As evident from these ﬁgures, the
two frequencies approaches closer as the decay rate on the unstable mode become negative.

Bayesian inference results
Figure (5), Figure (6) and Figure (7) show the noisy measurement data and the associated true free-decay response
at the airspeeds U = 27.00 m/s, U = 32.40 and U = 37.80 m/s, computed at the 50%, 60% and 70% of the ﬂutter
speed, respectively. The standard deviation for measurement noise is 12% of the root mean squared (rms) value of the
true signal. These noisy measurement data are used for the Bayesian inference as described next.
To construct parameter priors, 10% COV is considered in the Gaussian distributions of mass (m), mass moment of
inertia about the elastic axis (IEA), heave and pitch stiffnesses (kh and kα), the normalized distance between the elas-
tic axis and mid-chord (ah) and the normalized static imbalance (xα) as described in Table 1. For the small COV,
we ignore the fact that negetive values may be produced in the strictly positive system parameters due to Gaussian
assumptions. The marginal prior pdfs of modal parameters are shown in Figure (8). The assumption of Gaussian
approximation for the modal prior pdfs in Eq.(19) can be validated from Figure (8) which shows marginal pdfs over-
lapped with the corresponding Gaussian distributions (in green color).
In Figure (9) and Figure (10), the two-dimensional joint pdfs of modal parameters are plotted at each airspeed and
between two airspeeds. Most of these modal parameters show signiﬁcant correlations as exhibited by their tilted elliptic
shapes in the subplots of Figure (9) and Figure (10). Note that the mass, stiffness and damping matrices nonlinearly
map to aeroelastic modal parameters (frequencies and decay rates). Hence the statistically independent Gaussian
randomness in the mass, stiffness and damping matrices can introduce correlations among modal parameters, including
non-Gaussian effects in their pdfs due to nonlinear mappings. However, for small uncertainty (i.e. small COVs), the
nonlinear mappings among input parameters (i.e. mass, stiffness and damping matrices) and modal parameters can be
locally approximated to be linear maps (functions) for the probabilistic analysis (related to transformations of random
vectors, see [28] for more details). In these cases, the Gaussian randomness in the mass, stiffness and damping matrices
will also lead to the pdfs of modal parameters which are nearly Gaussian.
The marginal posterior pdfs of modal parameters are plotted in Figure (11) – Figure (22) which are generated using
AMMCMC samples. These ﬁgures compare the posterior pdfs obtained using the ﬂat prior, independent prior and
joint prior of modal parameters. The corresponding modal priors (shown in blue color) are also plotted which are
obtained from MCS.
The modal frequencies and decay rates obtained using the ﬂat priors exhibit signiﬁcant bias and uncertainty in their
estimates. Note that the posteriors of modal parameters are primarily governed by measurement data alone for the case
of ﬂat priors. In general, the uncertainties in the estimated modal frequencies are lower that those in the decay rates.
The modal parameter posteriors are sharper (narrower) for the independent priors than the ﬂat priors. Hence the modal
frequencies and decay rates are better captured with the independent priors than the ﬂat priors. The uncertainties in
the estimated decay rates are reduced with the independent priors compared to the ﬂat priors.
In Figure (11) – Figure (22) , the marginal posterior pdfs of modal parameters obtained using the joint priors demon-
strate that the accuracy of the estimates is signiﬁcantly improved when statistical dependence of the modal parameters
are accounted for among airspeeds. The modal parameter posteriors are the sharpest (narrowest) for the case of the
joint priors compared to the ﬂat and independent priors. It means that the best accuracy in the modal parameter es-
timates is achieved when the statistical dependence among these parameters across the airspeeds are enfored through
the joint priors. The bias in the estimated modal parameters using the independent priors and the joint priors is due to
the ﬁnite information about the system encoded in the noisy and sparse observational data.
Figure (23), Figure (24) and Figure (25) show joint posterior pdfs of modal parameters among airspeeds estimated
using the ﬂat prior, independent prior and joint prior respectively. In Figure (25), some joint posterior pdfs estimated
using the joint prior show the statistical dependence (reﬂected through the tilted elliptic shapes) among modal parame-
ters across the airspeeds, while joint posterior pdfs estimated using the ﬂat prior (in Figure (23)) and independent prior
(in Figure (24)) can not account for the underlying statistical dependence among modal parameters across airspeeds.
Figure (26) shows joint posterior pdfs of ﬂutter margins for the airspeeds for the cases of the ﬂat prior, independent
prior and joint prior. The joint pdf estimated using the joint prior can predict the inherent statistical dependence of
ﬂutter margins between the airspeeds as reﬂected in the tilted elliptic shape (see the third column in Figure (26)). The
joint pdf of ﬂutter margin estimated using the ﬂat prior is non-Gaussian as shown in the ﬁrst column of Figure (26).
The symmetric elliptic shape (with respect to the horizontal and vertical axes) of the joint posterior pdf in the second
column of Figure (26) points out the statistical independence of the ﬂutter margins among airspeeds due to the use of
the independent prior.
Figure (27) shows the joint posterior pdfs of parameters B2 and B3 from Eq.(23) used to estimate the ﬂutter speed.
The best accuracy of the estimates of B2 and B3 are obtained using the joint prior (shown in the third panel), having
9
the most compact elliptic shape of the joint posteriors compared to the cases of the ﬂat and independent priors (shown
in the ﬁrst and second panels).
Figure (28) summarizes the main results of this paper. It shows the comparison of the posterior of ﬂutter speed es-
timated using the ﬂat prior, independent prior, joint prior and prior alone (i.e. ﬂutter speed pdf constructed just with
prior information alone without measurement data) with the true ﬂutter speed estimated using the deterministic calcu-
lation and least square ﬁt using the true ﬂutter margin values computed at three airspeeds. Note that the uncertainty
in the estimated ﬂutter speed (reﬂected by the width of pdfs) decrease while using independent prior and joint prior,
compared to the ﬂat prior. The uncertainty in the estimated ﬂutter speed is minimum for the case of the joint prior
as it contains the maximum prior information about the modal parameters among the airspeeds. For the ﬂat prior,
independent prior and joint prior, Figure (29) represents the bias and uncertainty through the box plots of ﬂutter speed
estimates corresponding to Figure (28). In Figure (28) and Figure (29), the corresponding colors match for the ﬂat
prior, independent prior and joint prior. For each prior in Figure (29), the middle horizontal line in the box provides
the MAP estimate of ﬂutter speed using the Bayesian inference. On the other hand, the top and bottom horizontal
lines above and below each box indicate the MAP plus three standard deviation and the MAP minus three standard
deviation respectively. The distance between the MAP estimate and true ﬂutter speed is minimum for the joint prior
(hence having the least bias). Futhermore the uncertainty in the estimated ﬂutter speed is also minimum for the case
of the joint prior. Table 2 shows the COVs of the estimated ﬂutter speed for the ﬂat prior, independent prior and joint
prior. As expected, the COV is minimum for the joint prior and maximum for the ﬂat prior.

While quasi-steady aerodynamic model are used in this paper, the Bayesian formulation of the ﬂutter margin method
is directly applicable to the case when unsteady aerodynamic effects are signiﬁcant (characterized by the reduced
frequency near ﬂutter speed). Even if the quasi-steady model is used when unsteady effects are signiﬁcant, the model-
ing error introduced through this assumption can be partly addressed through ηk term in Eq.(15). While the Bayesian
framework is illustrated using the classical 2-dof pitch-plunge model, the methodology is readily applicable to the con-
tinuous systems (three-dimensional wings) using the ﬁnite element method and aeroelastic modal anaysis (applicable
to linear dynamical systems with non-symmetric system matrices). The application of the Bayesian ﬂutter margin
method to the continuous systems is the subject of future research.

Conclusion
We report the generalization of the Bayesian ﬂutter margin method which relaxes assumptions made in the previous
work by Khalil et al.. In the previous formulation, no aeroelastic model was used which is required to construct the
prior of the modal parameters. Hence a non-informative (ﬂat) prior was used to infer aeroelastic modal parameters at
each airspeed. For uncorrelated Gaussian measurement noise, this assumption renders statistically independent modal
parameter vectors and ﬂutter margins across airspeeds. This restriction is relaxed by introducing an aeroelastic model
whose system matrices exhibit random variabilities. The joint probability density function of aeroelastic modal fre-
quencies and decay rates obtained from this stochastic aeroelastic model are statistically dependent among airspeeds.
The joint pdf of the collection of modal frequencies and decay rates for all airspeeds (at which tests are conducted) acts
as the prior in order to infer the joint posterior of modal parameters. The ﬂutter margins obtained from these posterior
modal parameters exhibit statistical dependence. This statistical dependence among the modal parameters as well as
ﬂutter margins across airspeeds can substantially the uncertainty in the predicted ﬂutter speed.
