ABSTRACT
This paper proposes a novel method for prevention of the increasing oscillation of
an aircraft wing under the ﬂexural torsion ﬂutter. The paper introduces the novel
multi-agent method for control of an aircraft wing, assuming that the wing sur-
face consists of controlled ’feathers’ (agents). Theoretical evaluation of the approach
demonstrates its high ability to prevent ﬂexural-torsional vibrations of an aircraft.
Our model expands the possibilities for damping the wing oscillations, which po-
tentially allows an increase in aircraft speed without misgiving of ﬂutter. The study
shows that the main limitation is the time, during which the system is able to damp
vibrations to a safe level and keep them. The relevance of this indicator is important
because of the rather fast process of increasing wing oscillations during ﬂutter. In
this paper, we suggest a new method for controlling an aircraft wing, with the use of
which it becomes theoretically possible to increase the maximum ﬂight speed of an
aircraft without ﬂutter occurrence. A mathematical model of the bending-torsional
vibrations of an airplane wing with controlled feathers on its surface is presented.
Based on the Speed-Gradient method a new control laws are synthesized.

1. INTRODUCTION
In this paper, we investigate airplane wing stability under the ﬂexural torsion ﬂutter.
This problem is strategically important for the aircraft industry.
In fact, after reaching a certain ﬂight speed, small oscillations of the wing begin to
rapidly and catastrophically increase until the wing breaks. The stability of an aircraft
wing characterizes the wing’s ability to maintain its integrity, when oscillations occur.
The design of the aircraft is resilient. During the ﬂight, its elements can experience
signiﬁcant strain. For example, on a heavy transport aircraft, even in horizontal ﬂight
at a constant speed, the deﬂection of the wing end is measured in meters, cf. [47].

Deformations of the wing aﬀect the size and distribution of the aerodynamic load.
They can lead to a loss of structural stability, both static (e.g. wing divergence) and
dynamic (e.g. ﬂutter).
Therefore, the issues of ensuring the required aerodynamic characteristics and wing
stability in various ﬂight modes of the aircraft are traditionally paid great attention to
when designing. It should be noted that the elements of wing mechanization that are
widespread in modern aircraft building (pre-ﬂaps, ailerons, ﬂaps, etc.) serve precisely
this purpose; in particular, in the most critical take-oﬀ and landing modes. However,
there are no ways to eﬀectively counter wing ﬂutter.
Flutter is a phenomenon, which occurs after reaching a certain ﬂight speed Vflat,
when small wing oscillations begin to increase until the wing breaks. To avoid such
consequences, currently one imposes a limit on the maximum ﬂight speed of the air-
craft, calculated as (1.2 − 1.3)Vmax = Vflat. This signiﬁcantly reduces the potential
technical characteristics of the aircraft.
As a rule, an order to avoid the occurrence of ﬂutter, lots of limitations are intro-
duced on the maximum ﬂight speed of the aircraft, which depends on the speed, at
which the ﬂutter Vflat occurs. This practice signiﬁcantly lowers the potential perfor-
mance of the aircraft. By eﬀectively avoiding ﬂutter, it becomes possible to remove
such restrictions and use the aircraft more eﬃciently.
Until now, there are no eﬀective methods for dealing with ﬂutter. The designers
strive to increase Vflat as much as possible in order to raise the aircraft’s high-speed
ceiling. However, the existing approaches to increasing Vflat are strongly limited by
the features of speciﬁc aircraft models and their characteristics.
In this paper, in order to solve the described problem, we propose to cover an aircraft
wing with lots of small-sized movable elements, which are capable of purposefully
changing their orientation in the air ﬂow. The movable elements allow creating of
additional forces and moments, acting on the wing and preventing the growth of its
deformations.
Suppose that the entire free surface of the wing is covered with such controllable
elements: we call them feathers. The wing is covered with such feathers both above
and below, and in the neutral position, they do not change the calculated wing proﬁle,
see Fig.1. The last condition ensures that the wing dynamics does not deteriorate with
passive feathers in the neutral position.

The novelty of our approach lies in the use of ’feathers’ on the surface of the aircraft.
In this way, the wing of the aircraft becomes a multi-agent system, which we control,
based on methods from control theory. This approach is new and has not been used
before in the problem of dealing with ﬂutter.
The proposed approach should improve the existing situation due to the following:
the controlled elements (feathers) can change their position in the air ﬂow in such a
way that they prevent the occurrence of oscillations and general deformation of the
wing. Moreover, the feathers in their neutral position do not change the calculated
wing proﬁle. This ensures that the dynamics of the wing do not deteriorate even if
they are turned oﬀ and are not used (which corresponds to passive feathers in neutral).
In this paper, we propose the laws of control of an airplane wing with ’feathers’.
However, these laws are rather theoretical ones. In practice, a critical performance
indicator is the time, needed for the system to damp and maintain vibrations to a safe
level. The relevance of this indicator is due to the rather rapid process of increasing
wing oscillations during ﬂutter. In theory, we believe that the ’feather’ changes its
orientation in the air ﬂow instantly. Unfortunately, in real physical systems, there is
always a delay. The impact of the delay on our theoretical conclusions should be rather
investigated in the further works.
The rest of the paper is structured in the following way: Section 2 provides overview
of related work. Section 3 is devoted to study of the equation of system dynamics
for small ﬂexural-torsional vibrations of a wing with feathers on the surface. Section
4 describes the synthesis of the dynamic system control law, based on the speed-
gradient method. A control law is obtained in the form of feedback on deviation with
constant coeﬃcients. Section 5 introduces the transition to multi-agent control. Section
6 summarizes the paper.
2. RELATED WORK
The ﬂight condition boundary between stable and self-sustaining motions is known as
ﬂutter speed and ﬂutter boundary. There are several types of ﬂutter, which signiﬁcantly
vary depending on the way, in which the stability is lost with the any change in ﬂight
conditions like increase in dynamic pressure. An explosive ﬂutter occurs after a small
increase of speed from just below the ﬂutter speed to slightly above the ﬂutter speed.
This results in highly divergent oscillations and wing break within a fraction of a
second.
The moderate ﬂutter occurs when loss of stability can be identiﬁed well below
the ﬂutter speed. In this case, the ﬂutter speed can be predicted by extrapolating
instabilities. The mild type ﬂutter occurs when the system is stable but lowly damped
signiﬁcantly before the ﬂutter speed.
Unlike traditional stable aircraft ﬂight control systems, which aim to improve sta-
bility, improve handling, gust alleviation, control ride comfort etc., the approach which
aims to stabilize an unstable system is called Active Flutter Suppression (AFS). The
AFS system must stabilize an aeroelastic system that would otherwise be unstable
in all ﬂight conditions and aircraft maneuvers, covering all conﬁguration and loading
options as well as all ﬂutter mechanisms. That is why AFS is important for eﬀective
solution of aeroelastic instability problems. AFS can lead to signiﬁcant weight savings
and more eﬃcient and versatile airframes as described in particular in [2]. A broad
overview of AFS research is rather presented in [33]. The ability to suppress ﬂutter
instability through actively controlled closed-loop action of control surfaces has a long
3
history, see, for example [1]. Numerous studies in the ﬁeld of AFS were carried out
as early as the 1970s and 1980s, cf. [3]. Various approaches to the synthesis of AFS
systems control law, including methods of adaptive control and control with variable
parameters, are considered also in [14–17].
The physics-based approach of AFS research of [18] investigates the laws of ﬂutter
control, based on searching the physical or mathematical structure of the ﬂutter prob-
lem in order to identify the mechanisms responsible for the ﬂutter instability and ﬁnd
the ways to suppress them. The concepts of ‘active ﬂexible wing’ or ‘active ﬂexible
airframe’ are considered in [8]; ﬂight stability and controllability of rigid and ﬂexible
aircraft are considered in [4–6]; the inﬂuence of aeroelastic behavior on stability and
controllability of ﬂight using corrections to the derivatives of static aeroelastic stability
was studied in [7]; the perspective of using active controls is presented in [10].
The idea of using an active control system, according to which special mechanisms
are located on the wing of the aircraft that control the surfaces of the airframe to
achieve the desired dynamic behavior, has been considered and discussed from the
ﬁrst days of manned ﬂights, cf.[4,5]. Adaptive control is attractive in the case of ﬂutter
suppression due to many variations in plant characteristics and ability to respond to
damage scenarios, cf. [20–25]. In [19], an attempt is made to order and reduce various
laws of modern control theory used to suppress ﬂutter.
Control problems of nonlinear systems, as well as topological aspects of active sys-
tems, are considered in [27–31]. A broad review of methods for the synthesis of control
laws and modeling of aeroelastic systems is rather presented in [32]. The identically lo-
cated accelerometers and forces method is used to create an eﬀective viscous damping
matrix for the equations of the system that would stabilize it [16]. A similar approach
to the active control of structures with guaranteed stability is presented in [17]. Control
laws that modify the net stiﬀness and mass distribution are investigated in [15].
Other aspects of the problem of the ﬂutter suppression law are discussed in [26,31].
The inﬂuence of control system hardware delays, which is very important in the case
of ﬂutter, is considered in [26]. A special approach to active control of systems with
changing parameters and control of nonlinear aeroelastic systems is investigated in [27–
30]. Broader prospects for the use of AFS in practice appeared with the development
of fast drives and actuators [9]. Overview of aeroservoelasticity is done in [11].
Today it is possible to carry out high accuracy aerodynamic modeling of active
controlled systems based on control laws, which were usually synthesized using low-
order mathematical models [12,13]. However, such models still pose a serious problem
for developers and designers due to their large size.
The ﬂutter behavior is investigated in numerous more recent works; cf. [35,38]. A
control system, applied to transonic ﬂutter suppression, is presented in [37]. Robustness
to measurement noises and time delay is demonstrated. Stochastic modeling, based
on the ﬁrst-order reliability method for ﬂutter reliability analysis of an aircraft wing
is proposed in [35]. General aero-elastic system in a subsonic regime is investigated in
[36]. As part of aeroelastic analysis a ﬂutter speed for a more fuel eﬃcient slender wing
is identiﬁed in [34]. A systematic robust control design method for AFS is provided in
[38]. The method is used to increase the ﬂutter speed of a small unmanned aircraft.
AFS continues to be considered with caution and is prohibited from use on com-
mercial and military aircraft. This is because a failure of the AFS system while the
divergent ﬂutter is unstable can lead to the failure of the airframe so quickly that the
crew cannot react in any way, for example, by reducing the ﬂight speed.
Multi-agent systems (MAS) have numerous applications like civilian, security and
military ones. Centralized quantitative and qualitative modeling, analysis, constraint
4
satisfaction, maintenance and control seem to be too strict for these systems. On the
other hand, the distributed and incremental reasoning on the systems seems to be
more scalable, robust, and ﬂexible. That is why an investigation of multi-agent con-
trol systems is popular nowadays and has been researched for decades, cf. [40,41,43].
Multiagent approach is able to replace the general model of the interactions in a com-
plex system with a set of local models. This can be eﬀectively applied in distributed
nonstationary systems such as dynamical networks of [35,44], where the problem of
consensus is investigated. Agents can be modeled as integrators on segments, cf. [40,42].
The problem of control goal achievement for such agents is closely related to the con-
sensus problems of [39,44] and can be reduced to it in some cases as described in [42].
Consensus in multi-agent network systems from MaxEnt perspective is investigated in
[39]. For more details, see, for example, [54,55].
Dynamical networks and multi-agent protocol for the airplane is investigated in
[45,51]. The wing is covered with controlled agents ’feathers’ and multi-agent control
is used for leveling the perturbing forces in the turbulence. Each ’feather’ is controlled
based on a feedback about pressure of its own and neighbor feathers.
3. DYNAMICS EQUATIONS OF WING WITH FEATHERS
A wing with feathers has never been considered before for the problem of ﬂutter
suppression. Therefore, in this section we provide description of our novel approach,
based on the feathers. Let us consider the phenomenon of ﬂexural-torsional ﬂutter of
the wing as described in [48,49]. Let the plane be in a steady horizontal ﬂight at a
constant speed. We schematize the non-sweeping wing of the half-span l and feathers in
neutral position with a cantilevered beam. This beam is loaded with a static distributed
load on bending and torsion. The elastic axis of the wing passes through the Stiﬀness
Centers (SC’s) of the sections and does not coincide with the line of Gravity Centers
(GC’s) of the sections. We assume the wing stiﬀness in the longitudinal and transverse
directions of the wing plane to be very large. The assumption allows neglecting of these
types of vibrations. We also neglect possible movements of the SC and GC along the
sections during the ﬂight.
Figure 2 illustrates the following:
• O is the stiﬀness center of the wing section on the fuselage;
• X-axis is directed on a free stream;
• Z-axis is directed along the elastic axis of the undeformed wing;
• Y -axis complements the coordinate system to the right;
• x0 - is the distance from the leading edge of the wing to the SC section;
• σT - is the distance between SC and GC.
We note that typically the GC is located behind the SC section.
Figure 3 illustrates the following: b is the wing section chord; h is the transverse
deﬂection of the section A1A2; αCT is the angle of attack in the section of the un-
deformed wing; Θ is the angle of twisting of the section due to torsional deformations
of the wing.
The corresponding equations of the elastic line of the beam are of the form, cf. [1]:

where
• y is the deﬂection of the stiﬀness axis in the current wing section;
• Θ is the wing twist angle, which is considered positive if it increases the angle
of attack in the section;
• EJ, GJk are the wing stiﬀness in bending and torsion, respectively;
• q0 and m0 are the linear force and moment relative to the stiﬀness axis acting
on the wing.
The functions of Eq. (1) do not depend on time, since the wing is in a steady
(stationary) state; i.e. solutions of Eq. (1) can depend only upon z:
y = y0(z), Θ = Θ0(z).
(2)
These solutions must satisfy the boundary conditions at the ends of the wing:

Now, suppose that for some random reason (sudden aileron movement, air hole,
gust of wind, etc.), the wing deviated from its stationary position (see Eq. ((2))).
After termination of the reason of the deviation, the wing under the action of elastic
forces will move to its position of equilibrium. If the energy dissipation is not very big
then the aperiodic process will not occur; however, the wing oscillations will occur.
We assume that these ﬂuctuations are initially small enough and do not signiﬁcantly
aﬀect the dynamics of the aircraft.
According to [48,49], small bending-torsional oscillations of the wing, near its equi-
librium position (see Eq. (2, 3)) in the laminar ﬂow, are described by the following
equations:

(4)
where
• y1 and θ1 are the additional deﬂection and angle of twisting of the wing relative
to the stationary state (see Eq. (2),(3)), due to ﬂuctuations;
• m is the linear mass of the wing;
• Jm is the linear mass moment of inertia of the wing relative to its stiﬀness axis;
• qa and ma are the linear aerodynamic force of the wing and the linear moment
of the aerodynamic force relative to the stiﬀness axis, due to wing vibrations.
Solutions of the system (4) must satisfy boundary conditions similar to (3). We
represent the right-hand sides of Eq. (4) in the form:
qa = ∆qa + qu,
ma = ∆ma + mu,
(5)
7
where
• ∆qa and ∆ma are the linear aerodynamic force and moment relative to the
stiﬀness axis respectively, arising due to wing oscillations in the neutral position
of the feathers;
• qu and mu - the linear aerodynamic force and moment created by changing the
orientation of the feathers.
Following the ﬂutter equations (cf. [48], p. 176, Eq. (35)) and taking into account
linear aerodynamic forces and moment qu and mu, we rewrite Eq. (4) as

• α = αCT + Θ0 + Θ1 is the instant value of the angle of attack when the wing
moves;
• α0 is the value of the angle of attack at which Cy = 0;
• ρ is the air density.
As it can be seen from Eq. (6), the bending and torsional vibrations of the wing are
interdependent, which is one of the necessary conditions for the occurrence of ﬂutter.
It is also known from [1] that with increasing speed V, the frequencies of the bending
and torsional oscillations of the wing approach each other, and for V = Vflat they
coincide. Moreover, there is a phase shift between these oscillations, cf. [48,49]. The
last is also a necessary condition for the occurrence of ﬂutter.
It is important to emphasize that for V = Vflat the amplitude of the wing oscillations
is still small but remains constant. It means that the oscillations themselves are no
longer self-damped, as it was the case with V < Vflat. The problem arises when V >
Vflat, i.e. when the slightest deformations of the wing begin to grow catastrophically
quickly. Therefore, in terms of Eq. (6), to prevent ﬂutter, it is necessary to form qu
and mu so that the wing oscillation energy is always limited by a certain value. This
value is safe from the point of view of controllability, stability and integrity of the
aircraft structure. In other words, when speeds V > Vflat, for the full energy of the
cantilevered beam, cf [48], the condition must be:

and
∥¯x∥ is vector norm ¯x.
Power qu and moment mu impacts on the wing are formed due to the high-speed
pressure and therefore should depend on the velocity of the ﬂow of V, the position of
the feathers on the wing, their orientation as well as other factors, associated with the
adopted aerodynamic calculation scheme.
Let’s assume that the feathers are absolutely rigid structural elements, and that a
change in the orientation of the feather does not have a signiﬁcant eﬀect on the airﬂow
around the remaining feathers and the wing as a whole keeping it laminar. Then, we
receive:

(9)
where qui and mui are the additional linear forces and the moment from the i-th
feather. Summation is carried out over all the feathers, covering the boundary of the
section. The number of such feathers depends on z and is denoted as n(z).
Suppose that a feather can deviate from its neutral position by rotating around an
axis, passing through its leading edge and parallel to the Z-axis. Moreover, for the
feathers on the upper surface of the wing, the rotation angle is measured from the
tangent to the proﬁle at the point of rotation of the feather βi ∈ [0, β−], β− < 0, and
on the lower surface of the wing is measured as βi ∈ [0, β+], β+ > 0, corresponds to
the neutral position of the wing, and βi is considered positive if it locally increases the
angle of attack.
In Fig. 4, we use the following notation:
• A0 A1 A2 A4 are wing proﬁles (considered thin) in a static position (before
vibrations);
• ´A0 ´A1 ´A2 ´A4 are wing proﬁles during oscillations;
• E and E1 are SC’s of the wing section in the static position and during vibrations,
respectively;
• X-axis corresponds to the speed of the main stream;

• Y -axis is perpendicular to it and to the axis of rigidity of the undeformed wing;
• A1 A3 ´A1 ´A3 are the front and back edges of the feather 1 in the neutral position
on the corresponding proﬁles;
• A2 A4 ´A2 ´A4 are the front and back edges of the feather 2 (analogue of the
aileron) in the neutral position on relevant proﬁles;
• x∗
1 and x1K are the distances from the leading and trailing edges of the feather
1 to the leading edge of the wing;
• x∗
2 and x2K are similar parameters for the feather 2;
• EE1 is deﬂection of the wing;
• Θ1 is the angle of twisting of the wing near the point E1;
• β1 < 0 is the angle of deviation of the feather 1 from the neutral position;
• β2 > 0 is the angle of deviation of the feather 2 from the neutral position;
• ˆA3 and ˆA4 are the trailing edges of the feathers 1 and 2, respectively, after their
deviations.
Parameters Θ1, wing deﬂection yCT are ordinates in a static position, βi are con-
sidered small.
A similar ﬁgure for the aileron is presented in (cf. [47] p. 143, Fig. 41).
Following the technique suggested by (cf. [48], pp.143-146), it can be shown that
the inﬂuence of the i-th feather on the wing is generally calculated using the following
formulae:

Let us get back to Eq. (6). In [48,49], its solution near the ﬂutter is represented as
�
y1(z, t) = q(t)f(z),
Θ1(z, t) = r(t)φ(z).
(11)
Moreover, functions f(z) and φ(z) are functions of vibration modes, which must
satisfy the boundary conditions: at z = 0, f = 0; f′ = 0; φ = 0; at z = l, f′′ =
0; f′′′ = 0; φ′ = 0.
Here for the sake of simplicity, we take f′ = ∂f
∂z , f′′′ = ∂3f
∂z3 .
We substitute Eq. (11) into Eq. (6) and multiply the ﬁrst equation by f and the
second equation by φ and then integrate from 0 to l. After simple transformations
using Eq. (9) and Eq. (10), we obtain the following system

Given two functions f and φ and the known distributions of the mass and stiﬀness
parameters of the wing (we consider them independent of t), the coeﬃcients aij and
bij, i, j = 1, 2, 3 can be calculated and will be constants. The accuracy of the further
results depends on the choice of f and φ. Without going into details, we note that
with good accuracy these functions can be calculated, for example, by the method of
successive approximations. We complement Eq. (12) with equations for controls
˙β = u,
(13)
where u = col {ui,
i = 1, N} ;
βi ∈ [0, β+],
β+ > 0,

where n+ - is the
total number of feathers on the lower surface of the wing;

where n− = N − n+ - total number of

Then, we substitute Eq. (14) into Eq. (12) and reduce this system to the normal

Now we summurize the results of the section. We obtained an equation for the
dynamics of a system that describes small ﬂexural-twisting oscillations of a wing in
a laminar ﬂow, taking into account the linear aerodynamic force and moment, see
Eq. (15). Moreover, we obtained the equation for limiting the total energy of such a
system, see Eq (16). The rate of change of the angle of inclination of the ’feather’ in
relation to the wing plane can be selected as a control.
4. CONTROL SYNTHESIS WITH THE SPEED-GRADIENT METHOD
Up to this point, we have described the dynamic system taking into account how the
solution should look in the optimal state, determined by Eq. (16). However, we do not
yet have a control law that would allow us to control the system so that it reaches this
state. In this section we synthesize such a law.
First of all, we seek control for the Eq. (15) with the criterion of Eq. (16), using the
speed-gradient method introduced in [52,53].

where µi = a11s1i − a21s2i;
νi = −(a21s1i + b21s2i).
Thus,
dui
dt = −γi(µix2 + νix4),
i = 1, N,
γi > 0
or
dui
dt = −γi(µi ˙x1 + νi ˙x3) ⇒ ui = −γi(µix1 + νix3) + consti.
Since for x1 = x2 = x3 = x4 = 0 all values of ui = 0, and it means that consti =
0,
i = 1, N.
The resulting control equation
ui = −γi(µix1 + νix3)
(17)
is a control in the form of feedback on a deviation with constant coeﬃcients.
5. MULTI-AGENT CONTROL
Now, suppose that the feathers are some intelligent agents, such that each of them can
receive information about the movement of the wing in the area, where it is located,
exchange this information with other agents (transfer their information to them and
receive their information), process the received data and form local force and moment
impacts on the wing, trying to keep the wing as close to the curve as possible (see Fig.
2). Assuming the square of the feather is quite small compared to the surface of the
wing, we connect the feather with some point on the wing’s surface, when it is in the
neutral position, i.e. with some point on the wing surface that this feather covers.
For each feather (i = 1, N) we denote:
• ¯zi, ¯ψi - coordinates of the point to which the i-th feather is connected;
• y1i and Θ1i - deﬂection and angle of twisting of the wing at the location of the
i-th feather (deviations from the curve (2));
• Ni - the number of feathers with which the i-th feather can exchange information;
• ¯bij - non-negative weighting coeﬃcient of the signiﬁcance of information from
the i-th feather to the j-th. Here, we assume that ¯bij = ¯bji and �
j∈Ni ¯bij = 1 -
is the normalization condition;
• ¯bij = 0, if the i-th and j-th feathers are not connected informationally;
• ¯B = [¯bij] - adjacency matrix.

According to (8) and (11), for each i = 1, N it is necessary to provide

for t > t1 for a long period of time; t1 - the moment of reaching Vflat; Φi =

Moreover, we take into account that
∥Φi¯x − Φj ¯x∥ = ∥[Φi − Φj] ¯x∥ ≤ ∥Φi¯x∥ + ∥Φj ¯x∥ < 2ϵ = ϵ∗.
We deﬁne the quality of compensation for deviations from the stationary position
of the wing using the functional
L(¯x) = 1

(18)
We formulate the problem by analogy with [51] as follows. In conditions of uniform
rectilinear ﬂight of the aircraft in a laminar ﬂow, when approaching at time t0 to the
critical speed of onset of (ﬂexural-torsional) ﬂutter wing (and further exceeding this
speed), it is required to ﬁnd for each feather such controls ui of the system (15), which
would ensure for the goal functional of Eq. (18) the fulﬁllment of the target condition:
L(¯x) ≤ ϵ∗
(19)
for a small given parameter ϵ∗ > 0 for t > t1 during a suﬃciently long period of
time, where t1 is the moment of reaching the critical ﬂutter speed.

We suppose that ¯bij ≥ 0 ∀i, j which implies L ≥ 0.

which are determined by the topology of the agent network (for given functions of the
waveforms f(z) and φ(z)).
The case when χ = 0 or α = 0 is degenerate, because, in this situation, the functional
(20) is insensitive to the presence of feathers.
Following the Speed-Gradient method of [52] and using the equations (20) and (15),
we obtain:

(21)
Consequently:
dup
dt = −γp {χs1p ˙x1 + λs2p ˙x3} ⇒
˙βp = up = −γp {χs1px1 + λs2px3} , γp > 0, p = 1, N,
(22)
since the integration constant is zero for the same reasons as in (17).
The Eq. (17) and Eq. (22) have the same structure, but there are some diﬀerences.
In fact, according to Eq. (15), we can consider the coeﬃcients s1i and s2i as the
coeﬃcients of inﬂuence of the i-th feather on the force factor in bending vibrations
and on the moment factor in torsional vibrations, respectively. Actually, the values of
these coeﬃcients show the degree of participation of the i-th feather in wing dynamics.
In Eq. (17), the feedback coeﬃcients take into account the inﬂuence of the types of
wing oscillations on each other, while in Eq. (22) the feedback coeﬃcients for bend-
ing and torsional vibrations are strictly separated and determined through inﬂuence
factors only on its type of oscillation. Equation (22) is not multiagent by nature since
its dependence upon information about the state of other agents is static and it is
invariant to the dynamics of the i-th feather.
16
5.2. MULTI-AGENT CONTROL SYNTHESIS
Now, we go back to Eq. (15). We expand the vector of phase coordinates by introducing
˜xi = col {Φi¯x, βi} .
(23)
For this extended vector, we compose a functional – an analog of the functional of
Eq. (20)
˜L = 1
2
N
�
i=1
�
j∈Ni
¯bij ∥col {(Φi − Φj)¯x, βi − βj}∥2.
(24)
The application of this approach can be justiﬁed by the fact that for small deviations
of the wing from the stationary position, determined by Eq. (2), deviations of the
feathers from their neutral position βi, i = 1, N should be small as well. That is, at
least for feathers on one side of the wing (lower/upper), we have that
(βi − βj)2 ≤ β2
i + β2
j < 2ϵ2
β,
where ϵβ is some fairly small number.
After simple transformations, we get from (24)
˜L = L + 1

i=1
�
j∈Ni
¯bij (βi − βj)2 < ϵ∗ +

�
i=1

(25)
Now, we apply the Speed-Gradient method:

Finally, the control law takes the following form:
˙βp = up = −˜γp (χs1p ˙x1 + λs2p ˙x3) − 2˜γp
�
j∈Np
¯bpj(βp − βj), ˜γp > 0, p = 1, N.
(26)
It is important to note the multi-agent nature of the control protocol of Eq.(23)
and Eq. (26), since the control signal for the rotation of each feather is formed on the
basis of information about its own current state and on the basis of the current state
of the feathers associated with it: the second term in Eq. (26). At the same time, the
ﬁrst part of the law of Eq. (26) describes control in the form of feedback with constant
coeﬃcients according to the speed of deviation of bending and torsional vibrations
from the stationary state of Eq. (2).
17
It is essential that if ˙x1 = ˙x3 = 0,. Then this does not entail ui = 0, since in the
general case there can be x1 ̸= 0 and x3 ̸= 0. To reduce them, it is necessary to apply
a control deﬁned by Eq (26). The expression ˙βp = up = 0 is true only in the case
of complete absence of oscillations, when x1 = x2 = x3 = x4 = 0, since only then
βp = 0, p = 1, N.
The control of Eq. (26) does not explicitly depend on the time, at which the critical
ﬂutter speed is reached. The last allows using this control without any changes also in
the case of multiple transitions in speed across this boundary.
6. CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK
This work is the ﬁrst study of the authors, related to multiagent control of the wing
with feathers aimed to avoid increasing wing oscillations when approaching ﬂutter. In
the article - a mathematical model of the bending-torsional vibrations of an airplane
wing with controlled feathers on its surface is given; - three diﬀerent statements of the
control problem are considered, which diﬀer by the goal functional; - the three control
laws (Eq. (17), Eq. (22) and Eq. (26)) are synthesized by the Speed-Gradient method.
Only one of them: Eq. (26) is multi-agent.
Eq. (22) is an ”intermediate” one for the synthesis of a multi-agent control law.
It has a similar structure to Eq. (17), but takes into account the presence of other
feathers and their contribution. However, the information about them remains static.
It means that the state and dynamics of other pens is not considered. The multi-agent
control law allows for each feather to take into account information about its own
current state and about the current state of feathers in the area of the wing where it is
located. As a rule, this allows for more precise tuning and quicker tuning to external
factors, which makes this equation the most promising.
In the future, we advise to study the eﬀectiveness of the obtained control laws
and to compare them. The most critical indicator in the comparison should be the
time, during which the system is able to damp vibrations to a safe level and hold
them. The relevance of this indicator is due to the rather fast process of increasing
wing oscillations during ﬂutter. Another promising area for the further research is the
development of multi-agent management of feathers following the example of a swarm
and research its eﬀectiveness.
