Light Efficient Flutter Shutter,http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.01220v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.01220v1,"Flutter shutter is a technique in which the exposure is chopped into segments
and light is only integrated part of the time. By carefully selecting the
chopping sequence it is possible to better condition the data for
reconstruction problems such as motion deblurring, focal sweeping, and
compressed sensing. The partial exposure trades better conditioning for less
energy. In problems such as motion deblurring the available energy is what
caused the problem in the first place (as strong illumination allows short
exposure thus eliminates motion blur). It is still beneficial because the
benefit from the better conditioning outweighs the cost in energy.
  This documents is focused on light efficient flutter shutter that provides
better conditioning and better energy utilization than conventional flutter
shutter."
Probabilistic Prediction of Coalescence Flutter Using Measurements: Application to the Flutter Margin Method,http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15667v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.15667v1,"Zimmerman and Weissenburger's flutter margin method is widely used to
estimate the aeroelastic coalescence flutter speed. In contrast to aeroelastic
decay rates, the flutter margin exhibits monotonic decay with respect to
airspeed redering it effective in extrapolating the flutter speed using flight
test data conducted at pre-flutter airspeeds. This paper reports the
generalization of the Bayesian formulation of the flutter margin method by
Khalil et al. developed to tackle measurement and modeling uncertainties. This
paper improves the predictive performance of the previous algorithm by
incorporating the joint prior of aeroelastic modal frequencies and decay rates
among airspeeds in order to better estimate the joint posterior of modal
parameters using observational data. The modal parameter prior is constructed
using the classical two-degree-of-freedom pitch-plunge aeroelastic model whose
system matrices (e.g. structural stiffness and damping matrices) vary randomly.
Such joint modal parameter prior enforces statistical dependence among
posteriors of modal parameters and the associated flutter margins across
airspeeds. Numerical studies demonstrate a considerable reduction of
uncertainties on the predicted flutter speed obtained from the generalized
Bayesian flutter margin method. This improved algorithm can cut cost by
reducing the number of flight tests and better assess the uncertainty against
aeroelastic flutter."
Multi-agent control of airplane wing stability under the flexural torsion flutter,http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.04582v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.04582v1,"This paper proposes a novel method for prevention of the increasing
oscillation of an aircraft wing under the flexural torsion flutter. The paper
introduces the novel multi-agent method for control of an aircraft wing,
assuming that the wing surface consists of controlled 'feathers' (agents).
Theoretical evaluation of the approach demonstrates its high ability to prevent
flexural-torsional vibrations of an aircraft. Our model expands the
possibilities for damping the wing oscillations, which potentially allows an
increase in aircraft speed without misgiving of flutter. The study shows that
the main limitation is the time, during which the system is able to damp
vibrations to a safe level and keep them. The relevance of this indicator is
important because of the rather fast process of increasing wing oscillations
during flutter. In this paper, we suggest a new method for controlling an
aircraft wing, with the use of which it becomes theoretically possible to
increase the maximum flight speed of an aircraft without flutter occurrence. A
mathematical model of the bending-torsional vibrations of an airplane wing with
controlled feathers on its surface is presented. Based on the Speed-Gradient
method a new control laws are synthesized."
